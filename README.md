# Trullo
Proyecto Programación 5°C


## What is trullo?
*Trullo* is a collaboration tool that organizes 
your projects into boards. In one glance, *Trullo* tells you what's being worked on, who's working on what, and where something is in a process. Imagine a white board, filled with lists of sticky notes, with each note as a task for you and your team.
